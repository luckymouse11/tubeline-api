# React Tube Line Challenge

We would like you to replicate the task completed on Tuesday, and build an App to monitor the current status of the London Underground. The brief is the same.

Using the TfL API, build a mobile-oriented web app that:
• Lists the London Underground lines sorted alphabetically
• Shows the current status of each line
• Updates the status every 5 minutes -- This will be a bit trickier in React, and will take some Googling. 

Feel free to style the app as you wish, but see "example.png" below for a rough idea on what to produce. 


Use the same endpoint from the TFL API `https://api.tfl.gov.uk/line/mode/tube/status`. 


## Tips
  Remember to test endpoints with Insomnia before attempting to use them in your code.
  Do not copy and paste the solution from your vanilla JS version, but do you it to help you inform/plan your React version.
  Use your tools!
